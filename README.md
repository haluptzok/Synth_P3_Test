# Synth_P3_Test

A repo created in the format for synth to test the P3 puzzles

P3 puzzles come from here https://github.com/microsoft/PythonProgrammingPuzzles

Synth is a private repo that iterates through the Puzzles testing how many can be solved by ML methods

Unless you work on Synth - this repo is not very useful

"python gen_P3.py" -> generates src_gen_*.py and test_gen_*.py from puzzles.json
"pytest" -> runs all the test tests
